# Sudoku Solving
The idea behind this project is that if I use a MIN-MAX algorithm that I saw in the edX Harvard IA introduction course, in the future to determine faster ways to solve a sudoku puzzle I would have faster board solving.

The project right now can create boards and find all the solutions of that board. But they're the simple boards, high difficulty sudoku have more rules and those boards cant be created right now.
